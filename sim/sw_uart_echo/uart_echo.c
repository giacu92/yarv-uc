/*
 * UART echo + external-interrupt (MEIP) oracle.
 *
 * Two phases, so a failure says *where* the RX path broke:
 *
 *   Phase 1 (polling)  : echo PHASE_CHARS bytes read with uart_getc().
 *   Phase 2 (interrupt): enable CTRL.RX_IE + mie.MEIE + mstatus.MIE, then
 *                        sleep in wfi. The handler drains the RX FIFO,
 *                        echoes each byte and counts it. This is the only
 *                        test in the tree that exercises MEIP end to end:
 *                        uart_irq_o -> meip_i -> mip.MEIP -> trap_unit ->
 *                        interrupt entry, plus the wfi wake on an external
 *                        interrupt.
 *
 * Result marker: 0x600D (pass) / 0xBAD (fail) written to D-mem 0x3000.
 * 0x3000 rather than 0x2000 because .rodata is linked at 0x2000 -- writing
 * there would clobber the strings this program prints.
 *
 * Echo also makes it a hardware bring-up aid: type 8 characters on the
 * board and the first PHASE_CHARS come back by polling, the rest by
 * interrupt. Silence in phase 1 means bytes never reach the CPU (pin,
 * baud, sampling); silence only in phase 2 means the interrupt path is
 * broken while the data path works.
